Repository with source code of examples used in the refactoring hands-on taught by Rodrigo Martins Pagliares at UNIFAL-MG.

## 01 - refactoring-hands-on

First version of the example to be evolved during the hands-on. Although fully functional, this version has a very poor object oriented design.

## 02 - refactoring-hands-on

Second version of the example. This version builds upon the first version by applying the refactoring Extract Method (creation of the method quantiaDe(Locacao umaLocacao) from the method conta()).


## 03 - refactoring-hands-on

Third version of the example. This version builds upon the second version by applying the refactorings Move Method and Rename Method (Moving the method quantiaDe(Locacao umaLocacao)from the class Cliente to the class Locacao. After moving, we rename the method to lerPreco).
