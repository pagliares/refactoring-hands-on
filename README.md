# Refactoring hands-on

Repository with source code of examples used in the refactoring hands-on taught by Rodrigo Martins Pagliares at UNIFAL-MG.

## 01 - refactoring-hands-on

First version of the example to be evolved during the hands-on. Althoug fully functional, this version has a very poor object oriented design.
